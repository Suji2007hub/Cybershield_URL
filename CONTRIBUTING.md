## 🤝 Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](Code%20of%20Conduct.md) in all interactions with the community.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- A GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Node.js (v14 or higher) for running the local server

### Fork & Clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Cybershield_URL.git
   cd Cybershield_URL
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/Cybershield_URL.git
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure API Key

1. Get your Google Safe Browsing API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Never commit `.env` file** — it's in `.gitignore` for security

### 3. Run Local Server

```bash
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`

### 4. Open in Browser

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 📝 Coding Standards

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.)
- Always include `alt` attributes for images
- Use `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` for accessibility
- Keep markup clean and well-structured
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3)

### CSS

- Use CSS custom properties for colors and spacing
- Follow BEM naming convention for classes: `.block__element--modifier`
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use meaningful class names
- Avoid inline styles
- Keep specificity low
- Group related rules together

### JavaScript

- Use vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery)
- Use `const` by default, `let` for variables that change
- Avoid `var` declarations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments only for complex logic
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Handle errors gracefully

### Example Code Style

```javascript
// Good: clear, concise, follows standards
async function checkSecurity() {
  const input = document.getElementById('urlInput').value.trim();
  
  if (!input) {
    showError('Enter a URL');
    return;
  }

  const url = formatUrl(input);
  const result = await fetchSecurityData(url);
  displayResult(result);
}
```
